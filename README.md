**Knights of the Round Table Game**

I. Project Overview

A Web3 game that combines the elements of idle games, adventure RPGs, and card games. This project aims to issue the game token KnightGlodCoin (KGC) through the zkSync Era blockchain platform, providing players with a fair, secure, and immersive gaming environment.

II. Game Features

Unique Gameplay: Players can obtain a free hero and use KGC tokens to draw equipment and pets to enhance their combat power.
Arena Challenges: Players can participate in arenas to compete against other players, and winners have the opportunity to obtain mining rights in the token mine.
Mining Rewards: In the token mine, players can obtain additional KGC tokens through mining activities.
III. Technical Architecture

The game utilizes advanced blockchain technology to ensure fairness and transparency. All game data and transaction records will be permanently stored on the zkSync Era blockchain.

IV. Token Economy

KnightGlodCoin (KGC) is the official token of this game, used for various transactions and rewards within the game. Players can obtain KGC tokens through in-game activities, mining, or purchases.
